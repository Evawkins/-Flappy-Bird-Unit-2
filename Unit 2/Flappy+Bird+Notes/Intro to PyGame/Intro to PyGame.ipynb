For example, this is where we'd update the bird's position based on its velocity and gravity in a Flappy Bird game. The key idea is that the game state should be updated at a constant rate to ensure a smooth gaming experience.\n"

This command updates the entire screen with everything that's been drawn since the last screen update. Alternatively, `pygame.display.update()` can be used to update only portions of the screen, which can be more efficient.\n"
